            <p>I have experience with HTML, CSS, C++, Java, JavaScript, and Python. In the future, I would love to work as a UI/UX Designer but would also love 
                trying to work as a software engineer, front-end developer, and as a data analyst.
                As for my portfolio, it consists of a couple of websites I have made and played around with.</p>
